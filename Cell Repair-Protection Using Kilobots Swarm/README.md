 This work simulates the behavior of Cell Rovers, the cell sized bionanobots envisioned to be injected into Astronauts, by using a swarm of
Kilobots. Alone, each Kilobot is unable to perform any meaningful
function, but as a group they perform emergent behavior matching that
of as Cell Rover built using nanomaterials called Dendrimers. The
simulation captures the searching, movement, and protective behavior of
a Cell Rover, but fails to simulate the repair of the damaged bodies. The
paper explores and applies themes found in Particle Swarm
Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, and the Wolfpack Algorithm.
It is found that the concept underlining the function of a Cell Rover is
similar to a general optimization problem. The algorithm implemented
simulates the function of a Cell Rover, but could also be used as an
optimization algorithm where the strength of a chemical gradient across
a search space represents the objective function. An example of such an
application is to develop assembler nanobots that can actively repair
damaged Mars-suit by operating as space-filling polyhedrons.
